# Hi, I'm Dominic

I'm from Quebec ⚜️, Canada.
At [authentik](https://goauthentik.io), I work as a Technical Content Editor and Full-Stack Developer, contributing to [goauthentik/authentik](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik).

I run my own homelab and personal infrastructure, and I like building useful software and writing docs that are clear, practical, and actually helpful.

## Projects & Tools
These are some of my projects & tools.

- ❄️ [nix](https://git.sr.ht/~dominic/nix): my Nix setup for macOS and servers.
- ⌨️ [sdko-tool](https://git.sr.ht/~dominic/sdko-tool): `st`, my CLI/TUI for development and operations workflows.
- 👨‍🏫 [cobagrades](https://git.sr.ht/~dominic/cobagrades): CLI to fetch COBA (Berger-Levrault) student grades, then export to CSV and HTML.
- 🎧 [epub-audiobook](https://git.sr.ht/~dominic/epub-audiobook): CLI to convert EPUB books into narrated audiobook MP4 files.
- 🗃️ [gitweb](https://git.sr.ht/~dominic/gitweb): my cgit fork. _(archived)_

<details>
<summary><strong>Why I keep everything in my monorepo (and use a branch-first workflow)</strong></summary>

Short version: I keep my code in my monorepo for control, simplicity, and safety.
- I don't trust Microsoft/GitHub as my only source of truth.
- I don't like the direction GitHub keeps heading.
- I still like the older git flow and a bit of nostalgia: branches, patches, and direct review without PR-heavy workflows.
- I don't need most premium platform features; I prefer a lean setup I understand end to end.
- Running my own git stack keeps the threat model smaller and easier to reason about.
- Internally, my remote is a self-hosted Forgejo instance; selected OSS projects are mirrored to SourceHut (`git@git.sr.ht:~dominic/*`).
- I can land cross-project changes together and keep shared tooling/hooks aligned.
- Mirrors still give each project a clean public repo.
