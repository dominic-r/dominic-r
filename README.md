# Hi, I'm Dominic

I'm from Quebec ⚜️, Canada.
At [authentik](https://goauthentik.io), I work as a Technical Content Editor and Full-Stack Developer, contributing to [goauthentik/authentik](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik).

I run my own homelab and personal infrastructure, and I like building useful software and writing docs that are clear, practical, and actually helpful.

## Projects
These repos are mirrored from my monorepo:

- [gitweb](https://github.com/dominic-r/gitweb): my cgit fork.
- [nix](https://github.com/dominic-r/nix): my Nix setup for macOS and servers.
- [sdko-tool](https://github.com/dominic-r/sdko-tool): `st` _(soon)_, my CLI/TUI for development and operations workflows.

<summary><strong>Why the monorepo?</strong></summary>

Short version: control, simplicity, and safety.
- I don't trust Microsoft/GitHub as my only source of truth.
- I don't like the direction GitHub keeps heading.
- I still like the older git flow and a bit of nostalgia: branches, patches, and direct review without PR-heavy workflows.
- I don't need most premium platform features; I prefer a lean setup I understand end to end.
- Running my own git stack keeps the threat model smaller and easier to reason about.
- My canonical remote is my own git setup: gitweb (my cgit fork) over SSH.
- I can land cross-project changes together and keep shared tooling/hooks aligned.
- Mirrors still give each project a clean public repo.

Thanks for stopping by.
